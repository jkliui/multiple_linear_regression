Multiple\_linear\_regression model for prediction of house price



\# Multiple Linear Regression from Scratch



\## Project Description

This project implements a multiple linear regression model from scratch using the gradient descent algorithm. It aims to demonstrate the complete process of training, evaluating, and visualizing a machine learning model through a simple house price prediction case study.



\## File Structure

\- `multiple\_linear\_regression.ipynb`: Contains the complete code, detailed comments, and all execution outputs, making it easy for learning and understanding.

\- `multiple\_linear\_regression.py`: A runnable Python script that includes all core functions and the main program logic.

\- `requirements.txt`: A list of required Python libraries for the project.
